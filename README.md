reworked the selfbot with permission of creator.

run the "launch" file before anything.

then proceed to open config put your token and password (password is optional).

after doing so you should just run the "run" file and you're good to go.

also selfbots can indeed get you disbaled do not blame me for anything that you do end up doing with this tool.
